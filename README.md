# bannoCode

Just an overview of what I did and tried to do. A little background on myself and experience with this sort of work. My previous work in JavaScript
was hard to really take things away because I jumped into the deep end without ever having known what the shallow end might be like. 
I had no previous knowledge of how to write html other than small glimpses of it during my first internship 3 years ago, so doing this I had to
kind of relearn or teach myself how it is structured and where I might find things as well as learning what web scraping was and how to go about it. 

I spent a few days trying to google and find different ways and tutorials on how to go about it and I settled with Node.js and Cheerio as well as Axios. I'm still trying to understand what Axios is, but I know Cheerio 
operates like jQuery. I made small bits of progress but was not having a lot of luck with the little time I had to finish the project.

But in doing all of this, I didn't want to submit it late so I settled with being able to return the entire html setup to the console. I thought that was a victory for myself.

I hope the progress I made and the steps I took in doing so don't go overlooked.

Thank you for the opportunity and exposure.
